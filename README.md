This project aims to predict house prices using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.
Objectives
- To build a predictive model for house prices.
- To understand the importance of different features in predicting house prices.
- To evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.
